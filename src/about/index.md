## About me

### School
I am currently senior in the best high school in Serbia(Mathematical Grammar School) and we have really good mathematics and programming teachers.

I started learning C/C++ in first grade, but soon after begun learning algorithms and practicing on websites like CodeForces.
Since I was young I was really interested in how computers and tehnology work and programming helped me step up in that direction.
