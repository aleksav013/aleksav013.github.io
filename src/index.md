# Introductory
My name is Aleksa, and I am currently 17 years old.
I started experimenting with GNU/Linux a little more than year ago, and immediatly fell in love with it. 
I am currently using Artix with my own debloated kernel.

## Current goals
- Battle for debloated software (especially web)

## Software I use
- Suckless utilities
    - [my dwm](https://github.com/aleksav013/dwm)
    - [my st](https://github.com/aleksav013/st)
    - dmenu
- sxiv
- ranger (better than lf)
- youtube-dl

## Background

### GNU/Linux 
My Linux story starts with falling for the Arch superiority meme, and installing it for 100 times in VirtualBox VM.
I started getting into UNIX philosophy soon after and started using suckless software and praying to our and only Luke Smith and also Mental Outlaw.

At the moment I thought I needed wind\*ws, so I was mainly using Linux in VMs and was messing with old Pentium 4 32bit PC from early 2000's.
I installed things like FreeNAS and also had Arch and Debian home server on which I was hosting my website for some time(dad trought I was mining BTC), but it was dying and burning money(so much power usage) so I gave up on it.

I also wanted to buy a RPi for quite much time but I did not have money.
I would like to have home DNS server(PiHole) or a simple website hosting, way to access my home network or a simple cronjob machine. It would use less power than LEDs in my room so it would be perfect.

### School
I am currently senior in the best high school in Serbia(Mathematical Grammar School) and we have really good mathematics and programming teachers.

I started learning C/C++ in first grade, but soon after begun learning algorithms and practicing on websites like CodeForces.
Since I was young I was really interested in how computers and tehnology work and programming helped me step up in that direction.

### LaTeX
While currently writing in markdown, I must not forget my LaTeX journey.
Just before getting into high school, my main field was mathematics so w\*rd was not suiting my needs anymore.
My mentor at RCT "Mihajlo Pupin" reccomended me to try LaTeX.
It was the best decision I ever made.
Combined with programming lessons in school, it led me to become indenpendant of MS bullshit and fall for the meme.

### Using GNU/Linux on hardware
Just few months ago, after realizing that AUR has all proprietary bullshit I need for school, and Bill Gates spyware started crashing again, I decided it is enough.
Took me a week to get adapted and I could not be happier.
After a few months of using Arch and messing with my friends for using 10 times more RAM than me, I decided than I need to lower my RAM usage yet more.
I first removed (soy)stemd, thus following Luke's path more than I needed.
After that, I went on to remove all unused modules from kernel and trim it until it was perfect.

### Distros I tried or used
- Arch, Artix
- Gentoo
- Void
- Debian
- Kali, Parrot
- FreeNAS

### Plans
- Get into BSD
- Get an award for competitive programming
- LFS
- Adding hacking
