## LaTeX journey
While currently writing in markdown, I must not forget my LaTeX journey.
Just before getting into high school, my main field was mathematics so w\*rd was not suiting my needs anymore.
My mentor at RCT "Mihajlo Pupin" reccomended me to try LaTeX.
It was the best decision I ever made.
Combined with programming lessons in school, it led me to become indenpendant of MS bullshit and fall for the meme.
