## Hacking

I was always into the idea of hacking but never got time or perseverance to learn it.

### HTB
I know the basics, but it is really hard for beginners to actually do the box by yourself and need to follow the tutorials quite often which is really boring.
So usually when I get motivation from watching IppSec videos, I do not last longer than a week actually trying with HTB before giving up.
Might learn it if i have a lot of spare time but i highly doubt it.

### WiFi hacking
Friend has really shitty internet, so I came up with a plan to get into his neighbours internet by using aircrack-ng.
Actually never hacked into one, for a simple reason as there are no Serbian password dictionaries that I could use for cracking WPA2, and I really could not bother with making one.
I got idea to use Evil Twin attack but his adapter/VM instance of {Debian/Parrot/Kali} just did not work so we gave up on that idea.
Might do WPS cracking, if I get RPi for summer, just because it can take so long with time limit between tries.
