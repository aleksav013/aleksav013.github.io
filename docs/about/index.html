<h2 id="About%20me">About me</h2>

<h3 id="School">School</h3>

<p>I am currently senior in the best high school in Serbia(Mathematical Grammar School) and we have really good mathematics and programming teachers.</p>

<p>I started learning C&#47;C++ in first grade, but soon after begun learning algorithms and practicing on websites like CodeForces.
Since I was young I was really interested in how computers and tehnology work and programming helped me step up in that direction.</p>
