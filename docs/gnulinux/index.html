<h2 id="GNU&amp;#47;Linux">GNU&#47;Linux</h2>

<p>My Linux story starts with falling for the Arch superiority meme, and installing it for 100 times in VirtualBox VM.
I started getting into UNIX philosophy soon after and started using suckless software and praying to our and only Luke Smith and also Mental Outlaw.</p>

<p>At the moment I thought I needed wind*ws, so I was mainly using Linux in VMs and was messing with old Pentium 4 32bit PC from early 2000&#8217;s.
I installed things like FreeNAS and also had Arch and Debian home server on which I was hosting my website for some time(dad trought I was mining BTC), but it was dying and burning money(so much power usage) so I gave up on it.</p>

<p>I also wanted to buy a RPi for quite much time but I did not have money.
I would like to have home DNS server(PiHole) or a simple website hosting, way to access my home network or a simple cronjob machine. It would use less power than LEDs in my room so it would be perfect.</p>

<p>Just few months ago, after realizing that AUR has all proprietary bullshit I need for school, and Bill Gates spyware started crashing again, I decided it is enough.
Took me a week to get adapted and I could not be happier.
After a few months of using Arch and messing with my friends for using 10 times more RAM than me, I decided than I need to lower my RAM usage yet more.
I first removed (soy)stemd, thus following Luke&#8217;s path more than I needed.
After that, I went on to remove all unused modules from kernel and trim it until it was perfect.</p>
